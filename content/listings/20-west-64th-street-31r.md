Welcome home to residence 31R, a contemporary haven with direct Central Park views. Exceptionally re-designed with function and luxury in mind, this home will keep you floating on cloud 9.  
  
This 1,100 square foot, corner 2 bedroom/ 2 bathroom elicits grandeur with its bright and airy interiors, and open layout. The minimalist aesthetic is complemented by a very unique all-white palette that further accentuates the spaciousness, and emphasizes the striking Central Park views. The wide-plank, white-washed floors add an elegant touch.  
  
The open kitchen follows the all-white palette, and effortlessly connects to the living room, adding warmth and centering the home. The paneled appliances enhance the sleek design, while the custom electronic cabinets and drawers add convenience and comfort. The cabinets are adorned with white Caesarstone countertops and slight touches of stainless steel appliances.  
  
The master bedroom suite branches off the living room via large folding doors, and features a large, custom-built walk-in closet and private bathroom. The second bedroom is located in the opposing diagonal corner of the apartment and features stunning Central Park views. The apartment has ample storage throughout, including custom cabinets that line the walls of the apartment.  
  
One Lincoln Plaza is a full-service building with 24-hour doorman, state-of-the-art health club (with pool, sauna, and steam room), laundry on every floor, and garage with valet parking. The 20,000 square foot roof deck features 360 degree views of the city and fire pits.
