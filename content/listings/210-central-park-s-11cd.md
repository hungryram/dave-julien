ROOMS WITH "THE" VIEW!  
  
All buildings on Central Park South have stunning views of the park, but 210 Central Park South stands alone in its capitalization of place with floor-to-ceiling walls of windows and expansive balconies—roughly 50 feet in length. With the park-facing wall almost entirely glass, the drama of Central Park is evident in every aspect of apartment CD, which has been fully gutted renovated to a standard matching its place and view.  
  
This jewel-box of an apartment, designed by the renowned Lichten Craig Architecture + Interiors, evokes stylish elements of the 60s but with modern sensibilities. Luxurious details abound, including artisan-done luminescent gloss ceilings that reflect the light of the park, rock crystal chandeliers, and gilt-backed glass tiles. Every detail and finish choice speaks of elegant luxury as befits this 11th-floor beauty.  
  
No expense was spared in the renovation, including hand-painted wallpaper, top-of-the-line kitchen appliances (Sub-Zero, Wolf, and Miele), bathroom fixtures of the finest quality, gas fireplaces (Planika), hand-chosen slab marble backsplashes, extensive custom millwork throughout, with stone and tile of the highest grade rounding out the luxe surfaces.  
  
No description of this apartment could be complete without a comment on its Central Park view. The eleventh-floor altitude is simply magnificent, and the ideal perspective from which to enjoy New York City's most iconic landmark. Lower floors do not give you the elevation to appreciate the scale of the park, while higher floors, though impressive, leave one with a more abstract impression of the park. On the eleventh floor, one is immediately struck by the drama of the park which changes with the seasons and time of day. There are two punchlines to this gorgeous home: (1) breathtaking view of Central Park; and (2) immaculately designed with jaw-dropping finishes. Your home and its endless aesthetic enjoyment await you.  
  
210 Central Park South is a wonderful, full-service 1968 Cooperative apartment building in the heart of Manhattan. Convenient to public transportation. Contact us for a private showing.
