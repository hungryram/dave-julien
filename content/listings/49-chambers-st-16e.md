Residence 16E at 49 Chambers Street integrates luxurious modern interiors with classical Beaux-Arts architecture in one of the best lofts available downtown.  
  
The Building  
  
49 Chambers was originally designed to be the Emigrant Savings Bank by esteemed architect Raymone Almirall. Completed in 1912, it was the largest bank building in the world at that time, and the first to use an H floorplan, which allows for light and air in every corner of the building. Although originally used for office space, this floor plate creates gracious residences with open views and multiple exposures in each apartment, especially on the upper floors such as this residence which sits just one floor from the top.  
Magnificently designed and constructed, this building displays gracious Beaux-Arts elements such as generously scaled details, bold sculptural consoles, rich deep cornices, swags, and sculptural enrichments. Naturally, a building of this importance has been recognized as a landmark by the Landmark Preservation Commission in 1985, and by the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.  
Converted to condominiums in 2017, the building in its modern idiom enjoys a suite of top-notch amenities, including:  
24 Hour Concierge reception  
Swimming pool  
Spa whirlpool  
Sauna, steam room, and hammam spa  
Yoga/dance studio  
Men's and women's locker rooms  
Virtual golf  
Storage  
Screening room  
Resident's lounge  
Bike storage room  
A stunning roof terrace with multiple sun decks dining areas, a cocktail lounge, gas barbecues, and an indoor lounge with views  
Gymnasium with state of the art equipment  
  
Apartment 16E  
  
Bathed in light and views and enjoying three exposures, apartment 16E also features a primary suite separated from the other two bedrooms and home office. This ensures absolute privacy and sound separation for the primary bedroom. Additionally, as the apartment has three walls of windows, it has only a tiny fraction of shared walls with any other unit.  
  
The apartment is graced with a large chef's kitchen with cypress cabinetry by Minimal Cucine, a natural quartz waterfall island, countertops and slab backsplash, a top-of-the-line appliance package including a Wolf convection oven, SubZero refrigerator & freezer, Gaggenau gas burners with vented exhaust, and a Miele dishwasher and wine refrigerator.  
  
The master bathroom is sized for a mansion, with 5 fixtures, and marble, stone, and Waterworks features, including the largest single continuous mirror seen in New York City, complemented by cove lighting behind.  
2,975 square feet allow for a lot of storage space, with huge closets everywhere throughout and, of course, a washer dryer.  
  
This unit has undergone extensive improvements, such as:  
\-New Lutron automated shades in the living room and primary bedroom  
\-Lutron automated lighting  
\-New ceiling light fixtures throughout  
\-Wiring for wall-mounted TVs in office, primary bedroom, and living room  
  
The only E line being offered with western exposure (lower floors have those windows blocked), this high floor apartment/loft is a treasure that must be seen to be believed.
