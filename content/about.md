He went to Queensborough Community College for two years to study business administration before moving on to NYREI school in Manhattan where he graduated. His core values in the field of real estate are straightforward: he looks after his clients by providing them with quality customer service which includes paying attention to their needs and answering any questions that they have at all times during the process of looking for an apartment.

His core focus is to help my clients to achieve their real estate goals, to operate only in the best interests of my clients. He understands that clients and customers are his business, and they will be handled and cared for in the same way that he would like to be treated.
